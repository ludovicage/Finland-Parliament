# Finland-Parliament
This project contains a Python code that allows to webscrape the the website of the Finnish Parliament in order to create a dataset containing many information about the MPs (e.g: age, gender, birthplace, education). Thanks to this dataset, following the code it is possible to compute some descriptive analysis, such as the gender representantion and the over representantion of some geographical region. For the latter, it is important to know how to work with geographical panel data. Lastly, the code allows to perform Sentiment Analysis and Text Analysis using Press Releases of the Finnish Parliament.
